# Voice, Tone, and Writing Style Guidelines

This style guide is a reference for anyone who writes at Jet Admin. This is a work in progress, to be iterated on. 

## Voice and tone

Our voice is informed by our foundation as a no-code internal tool builder that helps create different tools for internal teams without engineers. 
We respects our client base which spans across two main types of users: **Users who build internal tools** and **Users who use Jet**.

Writing is one way we can bring Jet Admin’s values to life. And above all, our voice demonstrates our deep respect for our clients and users, we exists because of them, so it’s important we keep their needs at the forefront of our writing style.

Jet Admin's voice is:

* Customer-centric
* Genuine 
* Concise and clear
* Consistent


To achieve this, we keep the following in mind while writing content:


* Use simple, plain language that is easy to understand 
* Use direct, casual tone instead of an informal tone
* Make use of gifs and images for illustration.
* Write short, active sentences.
* Write for an international audience without idioms or expressions that people outside of your country/region are unlikely to understand.

The Jet Admin voice remains the same, even when the tone varies. Voice is to tone as climate is to weather

## Writing style

* We are using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) to edit our doc.
* Break long sections into smaller, easily digestable subpages.
* Use ordered lists or bullets where appropriate, as they are generally easier to read than long blocks of text.
* Minimize content so it can be found and remembered. Keep pages short, modular, and focused on a single topic.
* Use images and gifs when necessary to facilitate better understanding. 

## Markdown formatting

### Headers

* One space after hash
* Surrounded by a blank line
* No trailing punctuation
* Increment one level at a time

#### Example

```markdown
# Heading 1

Some context text.

## The next heading
```

### Content

* Don't use bare URLs: always use descriptive link text
* Inline code snippets use a single backtick
* Fenced code blocks are surrounded by blank lines and have a language specified
* Emphasis markers, code elements, and link text have no spaces inside
* Code or file names are enclosed by backticks
* Lists
    * are surrounded by a blank line
    * start at the beginning of the line
    * are indented with 4 spaces
    * have spaces after list markers
* Unordered lists use asterisks
* Tables
    * Use `---` for table header dividers
